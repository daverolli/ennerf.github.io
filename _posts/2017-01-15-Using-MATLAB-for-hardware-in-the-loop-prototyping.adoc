MATLAB(C) is a programming language and environment designed for scientific computing. It is one of the best languages for developing robot control algorithms and is extremely widespread in the research community. It is generally thought of as an offline programming language, but it is technically possible to include hardware in the loop. This post discusses the most common approaches and compares existing projects.

Prototyping directly on real hardware can significantly speed up development because it reduces the time between considering an idea and getting feedback on whether the algorithm can withstand real world physics. A workflow that requires researchers to port prototype code to another language before being able to test on real hardware can lead to multiple weeks or months being lost in chasing down rabbit holes. Additionally, programming in a language like C++ can pose a significant barrier to controls engineers who often don't have a computer science background.

We noticed that over the past few years several groups seem to have identified this as a problem and started to develop ways to control hardware directly from MATLAB. Since there aren't any guidelines for developing such interfaces, we looked at several different projects and compared the approaches they took.

Note that this blog post is purely focused on the MATLAB scripting language and does not discuss Simulink or code generation.

== Technical Background

The main limitation when trying to use MATLAB to interface with hardware is that the language is fundamentally single threaded. It has been designed to allow non-programmers to do complex math operations without needing to worry about programming concepts like multi-threading or synchronization.

This poses a problem for real-time control because all communication with hardware is forced to happen synchronously in the main thread. For example, if we were to run a loop at 100Hz and it took a message ~8ms for a round-trip, the main thread would spend 80% of the available time budget waiting for a response without doing any actual work.

A second hurdle is that while MATLAB is very efficient in the execution of math operations, it is not particularly well suited for byte manipulation. This makes it difficult to develop code that can efficiently create and parse binary message formats that the target hardware can understand. Thus, after having the main thread spend its time on waiting for and parsing the incoming data, there may not be any time left for performing interesting math operations.

Pure MATLAB implementations do work for simple applications, such as interfacing with an Arduino to gather temperature data or blink an LED, but it is not feasible control complex robotic systems at high rates. Fortunately, MATLAB does have the ability to interface with other programming languages that allow users to create background threads in order to offload the communications aspect from the main thread. This frees MATLAB to focus on the calculations that it has been optimized for.

Out of the box MATLAB provides two interfaces to other languages:  https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/introducing-mex-files.html[MEX] for calling C++ code, and the https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/product-overview.html[Java Interface] for calling Java code. There are some differences between the two, but at the end of the day the choice mostly comes down to personal preference. Both provide enough capabilities for developing sophisticated interfaces and have orders of magnitude better performance than required.  There are additional interfaces to https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/calling-external-functions.html[other languages], but those require additional setup steps.

In the systems we looked at we found two general approaches to integrate MATLAB with hardware. The most common way is to setup a distributed system in which the actual hardware communication is done in a separate process, and data is exchanged with MATLAB through a messaging framework such as ROS-messaging. This tends to be relatively hardware agnostic and easier to develop, but it does add additional burden during the setup phase and when evolving interfaces. The alternative approach is to create a standalone implementation that runs entirely within MATLAB.

////
== Message Passing Frameworks

In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing[Message passing] systems components communicate by exchanging messages rather than by calling functions directly. At the core they consist of two parts, a way to exchange messages (e.g. UDP or TCP), and a consistent messaging format. They allow system to be built with components (e.g. processes) that run on different computers, different operating systems, and different programming languages. 

These systems are great for larger research projects as they are very extensible and provide a simple way for prototyping. For example, a new component (e.g. a new walking controller) could be implemented in MATLAB and be integrated seamlessly with the rest of the system. Another common example is that an interface to real hardware can easily be exchanged for an interface to simulated hardware.

The ability to interchange components as well as the robotics community's widespread adoption of message passing systems (ROS, LCM, DDS, etc.) make them a great and relatively easy target for MATLAB bindings.

== Dedicated Product Interfaces

While there aren't many, there are at least a few companies that offer MATLAB interfaces for some of their products. These libraries are typically only useful to customers who bought a particular product.

== Distributed Systems

// Add some info here related to distributed systems and interface evolution / common pain points? Using several MATLAB instances that work together wth C++ processes?

=== Lightweight Communication and Marshalling (LCM)

https://lcm-proj.github.io/tut_matlab.html[LCM] is a message passing framework that was developed at http://www.mit.edu/[MIT] in 2006 for their entry to DARPA's Urban Challenge. In the robotics community it became a popular alternative to ROS and was as far as we know the first messaging framework that supported MATLAB as a core language. We found its implementation to be comparatively simple and would recommend it as a starting point when developing new interfaces.

The snippet below shows how the MATLAB code for sending a command message could look like. The code creates a struct-like _message_, sets some values, and publishes it on a selected channel. The encoding and transmission steps are hidden.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup
lc = lcm.lcm.LCM.getSingleton();

% Fill message
cmd = types.command();
cmd.position = [1 2 3];
cmd.velocity = [1 2 3];

% Publish
lc.publish('COMMAND_CHANNEL', cmd);
----

Receiving messages is done by subscribing an _aggregator_ to one or more channels. The aggregator receives messages from a background thread and stores them in a queue that MATLAB can access in a synchronous manner using _aggregator.getNextMessage()_. Each message contains the raw bytes as well as some meta data for selecting the appropriate type for decoding.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup 
lc = lcm.lcm.LCM.getSingleton();
aggregator = lcm.lcm.MessageAggregator();
lc.subscribe('FEEDBACK_CHANNEL', aggregator);

% Listen for messages
timeoutMs = 1000;
while true
    
    % Receive raw message
    msg = aggregator.getNextMessage(timeoutMs);
    
    % Ignore timeouts
    if ~isempty(msg)
    
        % Select message type based on channel name
        if strcmp('FEEDBACK_CHANNEL', char(msg.channel))
    
            % Decode raw bytes to a usable type
            fbk = types.feedback(msg.data);
            
            % Use data
            position = fbk.position;
            velocity = fbk.velocity;
        
        end
    
    end
end
----

Interestingly, the backing implementation of these bindings was done in pure Java and didn't contain any actual MATLAB code. The exposed interface consisted of two Java classes as well as auto-generated message types.

* The https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm/blob/master/lcm-java/lcm/lcm/LCM.java[LCM] class provided a way to publish messages and subscribe to channels
* The https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm/blob/master/lcm-java/lcm/lcm/MessageAggregator.java[MessageAggregator] class received messages from a background thread and queued them for MATLAB
* The generated Java messages handled the binary encoding and exposed fields that MATLAB can access

The snippet below shows a simplified version of the backing Java code for the aggregator class. Since Java is limited to a single return argument, the _getNextMessage_ call returns a Java type that contains the received bytes as well as meta data to identify the type, i.e., the source channel name.

[source,java]
----
public class MessageAggregator implements LCMSubscriber {

    public class Message {
    
        // raw data bytes
        final public byte[] data; 
        
        // channel on which it was received
        final public String channel; 
        
        public Message(String channel_, byte[] data_) {
            data = data_;
            channel = channel_;
        }
    }

    public synchronized Message getNextMessage(long timeout_ms) {
    
		if (!messages.isEmpty()) {
		    return messages.removeFirst();
        }

        if (timeout_ms == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        
        // Wait for new message ...
    }
    
}
----

Note that the _getNextMessage_ method expects a user settable timeout argument. In general it is important for blocking Java methods to have a timeout in order to prevent the main thread from getting permanently stuck inside Java. Otherwise this could cause the UI to become unresponsive and users may be forced to close MATLAB without being able to save their workspace. Being in a Java call also prohibits users from aborting the execution (ctrl-c), so timeouts should be reasonably short, i.e., in the low seconds.

Passing in a timeout of zero serves as a non-blocking interface that immediately returns empty if no messages are available. This is often useful for working with multiple aggregators or for integrating asynchronous messages with unknown timing, such as user input.

Similarly, the struct-like message types are actually Java objects that expose public fields. Users can access them the same way as fields of a standard MATLAB struct (or class properties) resulting in nice syntax. The types are automatically converted according to the https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/passing-data-to-java-methods.html[type mapping].

[source,java]
----
public final class command implements lcm.lcm.LCMEncodable
{
    public double[] position;
    public double[] velocity;
    // etc. ...
}
----

Overall, we thought that this was a well thought out API and a great example for a minimum viable interface that works well in practice. By receiving messages on a background thread and by moving the encoding and decoding steps to the Java language, the main thread was able to spend most of its time on actually working with the data.

Some minor points for improvement that we found were:

* The decoding step _fbk = types.feedback(msg.data)_ forced two unnecessary translations due to _msg.data_ being a _byte[]_, which automatically gets converted to and from _int8_. This could result in a noticeable performance hit when receiving larger messages (e.g. images) and could be avoided by adding an overload that accepts a non-primitive type that does not get translated, e.g., _fbk = types.feedback(msg)_.
* The Java classes didn't implement _Serializable_, which could become a problem when trying to save the workspace. 
* We thought that it may have been better to select the decoding type during the subscription step, e.g., _lc.subscribe('FEEDBACK_CHANNEL', aggregator, 'types.feedback')_, rather than requiring users to instantiate the type manually. This could clean up the code a bit and allow for a much less confusing error message if types are missing.

=== Robot Operating System (ROS)

ROS is by far the most widespread messaging framework in the robotics research community and has been officially supported by Mathworks' https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html[Robotics System Toolbox] since 2014. Simulink code generation was implemented on top of ROS C++ and the MATLAB interface was built on top of RosJava.

They designed the API such that each topic required dedicated publishers and subscribers, which was contrary to LCM where each subscriber was able to listen to multiple channels (topics). This in combination with specifying the type on initialization removed most of the boiler plate code necessary for dealing with message types. The resulting user code was more concise and was arguably more readable than LCM's interface.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup Publisher
chatpub = rospublisher('/chatter', 'std_msgs/String');

% Fill message
msg = rosmessage(chatpub);
msg.Data = 'Some test string';

% Publish
chatpub.send(msg);
----

For receiving messages they offered three different APIs: blocking calls, non-blocking calls, and callbacks. This allowed users to choose the style they were most comfortable with.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup Subscriber
laser = rossubscriber('/scan');

% (1) Blocking receive
scan = laser.receive(1); % timeout [s]

% (2) Non-blocking latest message (may not be new)
scan = laser.LatestMessage;

% (3) Callback
callback = @(msg) disp(msg);
subscriber = rossubscriber('/scan', @callback);  
----

We unfortunately haven't had a chance to use the library in a real project, so our impressions were purely based on looking through the toolbox files and the compiled Java bytecode. As far as we could tell they built a small Java library that wrapped RosJava functionality and provided an interface that was easier to call from MATLAB. Most of the actual logic seemed to be implemented in MATLAB code, but they made extensive use of various Java libraries for problems that would have been difficult to implement in pure MATLAB, e.g., listing networking interfaces or doing in-memory decompression of images.

The underlying Java interface was completely hidden from users as all of the Java calls happened inside of wrapping MATLAB classes. For example, there was a wrapper class for each Java message type that exposed typical MATLAB properties (get/set) that modified the state of the underlying Java object. Similarly, all Java exceptions got intercepted and wrapped in a MATLAB exception before being exposed to the user. The code below shows a simplified example of such a message wrapper.

[source,matlab]
----
% Simplified example of a message wrapper
classdef WrappedMessage

    properties (Access = protected)
        JavaMessage % The underlying Java message object
    end
    
    methods
    
        function name = get.Name(obj)
            name = char(obj.JavaMessage.getName);
        end
        
        function set.Name(obj, name)
            validateattributes(name, {'char'}, {}, 'WrappedMessage', 'Name');
            obj.JavaMessage.setName(name); % Forward to Java method
        end
        
        function out = doSomething(obj)
            try
                out = obj.JavaMessage.doSomething(); % Forward to Java method
            catch javaException
                throw(WrappedException(javaException)); % Hide Java exception
            end
        end
        
    end
end
----

Overall, we found that the ROS support toolbox looked very nice and was a great example of how seamless external languages could be integrated with MATLAB. We also really liked that they offered a way to load log files (rosbags).

One concern we had was that there didn't seem to be a simple non-blocking way to check for new messages, e.g., a _hasNewMessage()_ method or functionality equivalent to LCM's _getNextMessage(0)_. We often found this useful for applications that combined data from multiple topics that arrived at different rates (e.g. sensor feedback and joystick input events). We checked whether this behavior could be emulated by specifying a very small timeout (such as in the snippet below), but any value below 0.1s seemed to never successfully return.

[source,matlab]
----
try
    msg = sub.receive(0.1); % below 0.1s always threw an error
    % ... use message ...
catch ex
    % ignore
end
----

=== Data Distribution Service (DDS)

In 2014 Mathworks also added a https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/rti-dds.html[support package for DDS], which is the messaging middleware that ROS 2.0 will be based on. It supports MATLAB and Simulink, as 
well as code generation. Unfortunately, we didn't have all the requirements to get it setup, and we couldn't find much information about the underlying implementation. Based on looking at some of their intro videos, the resulting code looked as follows.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup
DDS.import('ShapeType.idl','matlab');
dp = DDS.DomainParticipant

% Create message
myTopic = ShapeType;
myTopic.x = int32(23);
myTopic.y = int32(35);

% Send Message
dp.addWriter('ShapeType', 'Square');
dp.write(myTopic);

% Receive message
dp.addReader('ShapeType', 'Square');
readTopic = dp.read();
----

=== ZeroMQ

ZeroMQ is another asynchonous messaging library that is popular for building distributed systems. It only handles the messaging aspect, so users need to supply their own wire format. https://github.com/smcgill3/zeromq-matlab[ZeroMQ-matlab] was a MATLAB interface to ZeroMQ that was developed at UPenn between 2013-2015. We weren't able to find much documentation, but as far as we could tell the resulting code should look similar to following snippet.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup
subscriber = zmq( 'subscribe', 'tcp', '127.0.0.1', 43210 );
publisher = zmq( 'publish', 'tcp', 43210 );

% Publish data
bytes = uint8(rand(100,1));
nbytes = zmq( 'send', publisher, bytes );

% Receive data
receiver = zmq('poll', 1000); // polls for next message
[recv_data, has_more] = zmq( 'receive', receiver );

disp(char(recv_data));
----

It was implemented as a single MEX function that selected the appropriate action based on the first argument. State was maintained by using socket IDs that were passed in by the user at every call. The code below shows a simplified snippet of the send action.

[source,c++]
----
// Grab command String
if ( !(command = mxArrayToString(prhs[0])) )
	mexErrMsgTxt("Could not read command string. (1st argument)");

// ...
if (strcasecmp(command, "send") == 0){
	// ... (argument validation)
	
	// retrieve arguments 
	socket_id = *( (uint8_t*)mxGetData(prhs[1]) );
	size_t n_el = mxGetNumberOfElements(prhs[2]);
	size_t el_sz = mxGetElementSize(prhs[2]);		
	size_t msglen = n_el*el_sz;
	
	// send data
	void* msg = (void*)mxGetData(prhs[2]);
	int nbytes = zmq_send( sockets[ socket_id ], msg, msglen, 0 );
	
	// ... check outcome and return
}
----

=== Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX)

OSRF developed a http://www.osrfoundation.org/haptix-simulation-of-prosthetic-devices/[MATLAB interface] for DARPA's  http://www.darpa.mil/program/hand-proprioception-and-touch-interfaces[HAPTIX] program that allowed users to interface with real hardware as well as a step-in Gazebo simulation. They chose to create an API that hides the messaging part from the user and exposes more product specific functions. The underlying implementation was based on http://ignitionrobotics.org/libraries/transport[ignition-transport] which was a combination of ZeroMQ with Protobuf as the wire format. 

Below is a copy of an http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=haptix&tut=haptix_matlab[example] from their website.

[source,matlab]
----
counter = 0;

hx_connect();

deviceInfo = hx_robot_info();

% Uncomment this block to start logging.
% hxs_start_logging('/tmp/log/')

while counter < 250
  cmdSent = tic;

  % Initialize the command scalar structure.
  cmd.ref_pos = [];
  cmd.ref_vel = [];
  cmd.ref_vel_max = [];
  cmd.gain_pos = [];
  cmd.gain_vel = [];

  % Indicate that the positions we set should be used.
  cmd.ref_pos_enabled = 1;
  % We're not setting it, so indicate that ref_vel should be ignored.
  cmd.ref_vel_enabled = 0;
  % We're not setting it, so indicate that ref_vel_max should be ignored.
  cmd.ref_vel_max_enabled = 0;
  % We're not setting it, so indicate that gain_pos should be ignored.
  cmd.gain_pos_enabled = 0;
  % We're not setting it, so indicate that gain_vel should be ignored.
  cmd.gain_vel_enabled = 0;

  % Create a new command based on a sinusoidal wave.
  for n = 0:deviceInfo.motor_count
    cmd.ref_pos(end + 1) = 350 * 0.5 * sin(0.05 * 2.0 * pi * counter * 0.08);
    % We could set a desired maximum velocity
    % cmd.ref_vel(end + 1) = 1.0;
    % cmd.ref_vel_max(end + 1) = 1.0;
    % We could set a desired controller position gain
    % cmd.gain_pos(end + 1) = 1.0;
    % We could set a desired controller velocity gain
    % cmd.gain_vel(end + 1) = 1.0;
  end

  % Send the new joint command and receive the state update.
  state = hx_update(cmd);

  counter = counter + 1;

  % Busy wait. pause() is not accurate enough on Windows.
  elapsedCmd = toc(cmdSent);
  while elapsedCmd < 0.02
    elapsedCmd = toc(cmdSent);
  end
end

% Uncomment this block to stop logging.
% hxs_stop_logging()

hx_close();
----
At the top level, the API consisted of https://bitbucket.org/osrf/haptix-comm/src/a961986b0254a3dbcabcc89ba14f78915d5d968a/matlab/[several MATLAB functions] that provided help text and forwarded calls to an underlying MEX function.

[source,matlab]
----
% Example for a forwarding function
% <help text>
function result = hxs_add_model(sdf, name, pos, orient, gravity_mode)
    result = hxgz('add_model', sdf, name, pos, orient, gravity_mode);
end
----

The MEX code was implemented in a similar way as the ZeroMQ-matlab project in that there was a single function implementation (https://bitbucket.org/osrf/haptix-comm/src/a961986b0254a3dbcabcc89ba14f78915d5d968a/matlab/hxgz.c[hxgz.c]) that expected a string as the first argument in order to select the desired action. The MEX function internally translated the additional input arguments according to the action, and called a corresponding function in their C API. The underlying C code then sent an appropriate message via ZeroMQ. The snippet below shows a simplified example for an action implementation.

[source,c++]
----
// Dispatch to the appropriate function based on the first argument
// ...
else if (!strcmp(funcName, "add_model"))
    hxgzs_add_model(nlhs, plhs, nrhs-1, prhs+1);

// ...   
void hxgzs_add_model(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[],
                int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]) {
    // ... input translation
    
    // Call to C API
    if (hxs_add_model(sdf, name, x, y, z,
                      roll, pitch, yaw, gravity_mode, &model) != hxOK)
        mexErrMsgIdAndTxt("HAPTIX:hxs_add_model", hx_last_result());

  // ... output translation
  plhs[0] = model_to_matlab(&model);
}

----

Note that their http://gazebosim.org/haptix[documentation] mentioned that the MATLAB API was generated from their C API. Without auto-generation it would be extremely tedious to maintain and extend four or more calling layers for every function.

Overall we found that their implementation was done quite well and we assume that they must have spent significant time on creating this interface. It was also nice to see that they included functionality to enable and disable logging.

While we really liked their implementation, we thought that some minor changes could simplify the resulting API:

* More than half of the example code could've been replaced by adding a helper function that returns a default command struct (or making it a class so that users can't mess with the fields), e.g., _hxs_command_struct()_.
* The disabled state could've been represented by NaN or empty values rather than introducing separate fields for boolean flags.
* https://bitbucket.org/osrf/haptix-comm/src/a961986b0254a3dbcabcc89ba14f78915d5d968a/matlab/hx_update.m[_hx_update()_] could've benefitted from a second return argument that indicates whether the returned state is new, and a blocking call with timeout to get rid of the busy loop.

== Standalone Systems

=== Arduino

Mathworks offered a https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino-matlab.html[support package for Arduino] that allowed users to interface with the pins on an https://www.arduino.cc/[Arduino] in real-time. It was implemented as a library that did not require external processes. Since an Arduino required firmware to run, the first instantiation automatically programmed a Mathworks supplied binary to the Arduino that let MATLAB establish a serial connection and exchange information. Dimming an LED based on some analog input looked as shown below.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup
a = arduino('com1','Mega2560');
potentiometer = 'A0';
led = 'D3';

% Dim LED base on potentiometer
while true
    value = readVoltage(a, potentiometer);
    writePWMVoltage(a, led, value);
end
----

We thought that this was a nice interface for Arduino users that is significantly more usable than the previously common approaches of exchanging strings over serial.

Unfortunately this interface also serves as a great example for the performance problems caused by the synchronous programming model. On our test machine we were only able to get about 80 operations (reads and writes combined) per second, so the above loop would run at maximum 40 Hz. This would be enough for simple Arduino-type problems, but far too slow for serious robotics applications.

Note that most of the overhead comes from waiting for device responses, so code generated from Simulink models that gets deployed locally on the device should be able to run significantly faster.

=== HEBI Robotics' Modular Actuators

Lastly, we developed our own http://hebirobotics.com/matlab[MATLAB API] for controlling modular actuators. We decided to implement it as a standalone library in order reduce the number of setup steps and to provide an overall better user experience. The below example shows a closed-loop controller implementing a virtual spring that uses torque control to drive the output towards the origin.

[source,matlab]
----
% Find actuator by human readable ID
actuator = HebiLookup.newGroupFromNames('Family', 'Name');
stiffness = 1; % [Nm/rad]

% Virtual spring using torque control
cmd = CommandStruct();
while true
    fbk = actuator.getNextFeedback();
    cmd.torque = -stiffness * fbk.position;
    actuator.set(cmd);
end
----

// TODO: expand?

The details of the implementation will be covered in a separate blog post.

////
The code below shows a full example of kinesthetic control of two 16-DoF snake robots where one acts as a master, and the other one as a slave that copies its motion. A single run lasts 60 seconds. The slave robot's data is automatically logged to disk and the position tracking error is plotted after each trial.

[source,matlab]
----
% Setup
master = HebiLookup.newConnectedGroupFromName('*', 'SA128');
slave = HebiLookup.newConnectedGroupFromName('*', 'SA119');
limpCmd = CommandStruct();
limpCmd.torque = zeros(1, master.getNumModules());

% Start logging to disk (background thread)
slave.startLog();

% Run Trial
cmd = CommandStruct();
t = t0;
while toc(t) < 60

    % Copy master feedback to slave motion
    fbk = master.getNextFeedback();
    cmd.position = fbk.position;
    cmd.velocity = fbk.velocity;
    slave.set(cmd);
    
    % Keep master in zero torque mode
    master.set(limpCmd);

end

% Stop logging and plot position error
data = slave.stopLog();
positionError = data.positionCmd - data.position;
plot(data.time, positionError);
----

 TODO: Add MSI picture or video? Alternatively, switch to a sine wave and add video of sidewinding?

== Other Hardware Interfaces

Below is a list of other APIs that we looked at but couldn't cover in more detail.

// Example1:

Message passing systems don't work very well for prototyping with modular systems. For example, consider a case of kinesthetic control where the feedback of a master robot is used to control a second slave robot. This would require changes to the messages, which always results in significant overhead. Definition need to be changed, messages need to be generated, the receiving process needs to be modified, everything has to be recompiled for the target platform and so on. This overhead is justifiable for static systems that live for a long time, but it is a dealbreaker for modular systems that were constructed and programmed in an hour for a quick YouTube video.


When showing syntax for other APIs that show setting of a position command, we can show the MSI demo of 1 limp robot controlling position/velocity on another. Maybe include logging as well.

Performance is actually better than original C++ due to no message passing overhead.

Original implementation required additional process that connects to robot and handles other message type.

== Final Notes

Contrary to the situation a few years ago, nowadays there are several available interfaces that allow researchers to do hardware-in-the-loop prototyping directly from MATLAB. If for some reason none of the existing options work for you and you need to write your own, we would recommend to start with an LCM-like implementation and to add complexity as needed. 

Interfaces that expose MATLAB code can provide a much better and more consistent user experience (e.g. help documentation), but they almost always require significant time investments to maintain all of the involved layers and to write tools for code generation.

If there is no clear preference between C++ and Java, we would recommend to at least start with a Java implementation. MEX interfaces require a lot of conversion code that MATLAB would automatically handle for Java calls.

 TODO: Should we include any history of snake lab and LCM -> LcmBridge ? If so, should this go into the HEBI section? What else should be in the final notes?

Keep in mind that research is also a very dynamic environment where needs and requirements can change all the time. Some of us used to work on the  http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/robots/index.php[snake robot project] at http://www.cmu.edu[CMU], which was entirely based on LCM. We used LCM's MATLAB bindings extensively, but we eventually hit a point where we needed to deal with many messages coming from many channels. This  significantly increased the parsing overhead and made the resulting code very difficult to maintain. We later built a specialized Java API that hid subscriptions and message conversion internally and exposed more convenient methods to user, similar to OSRF's approach for HAPTIX. 

The resulting API looked similar to the following.

        % command robot
        lcmBridge.setAngles(zeros(1,16));
    
    end

This custom API worked very well for our lab until we started building a much more sophisticated generation of hardware that had many tuning options that users needed to access. Due to the nature of message passing systems, each new sensor or settable option required changes to every level of the stack, including the firmware, the network protocol, the receiving process, the message type, as well as several API layers. It quickly became a maintenance nightmare to go through this many layers and we started to eliminate several of them by writing more sophisticated APIs that communicated with the hardware directly.
